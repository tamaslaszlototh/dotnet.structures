# DotNet.Structures

**DotNet.Structures** is a specialized .NET library that provides robust implementations of advanced data structures, designed for high performance and versatility in complex computational scenarios. This library is ideal for developers and researchers looking to leverage efficient and scalable data structures for sophisticated applications.

## Key Features so far
- **Priority Queues**: Implementations of min-heaps and max-heaps for priority-based data handling.

## Key Features on waiting list
- **Balanced Trees**: AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees, and B-Trees for optimized search, insertion, and deletion operations.
- **Graphs**: Graph data structures supporting various traversal and search algorithms (DFS, BFS, etc.).
- **Trie and Suffix Trees**: Efficient string search and manipulation structures.
- **Skip Lists**: Probabilistic data structure for fast ordered operations.
- **Segment Trees**: Ideal for range queries in static and dynamic datasets.
- **Other Advanced Structures**: Custom data structures optimized for specific use cases (e.g., Disjoint Set, Fibonacci Heaps).
- **And more**
